                Hypatia is a library for floating-point arithmetic that can handle unchangeable, arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers.

                The Num class has two internal representations of numbers, one is a fast fixed-point operation based on long. The other is an arbitrary-precision floating-point operation using BigDecimal.
                However, the internal representation is completely hidden and the user need not be aware of it.
